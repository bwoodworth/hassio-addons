# pentair-screenlogic

## Screen Logic AddOn for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) using the [node-screenlogic](https://github.com/parnic/node-screenlogic) library

## Instructions

* This addon requires a MQTT broker to pass state and commands to Screenlogic.

* Add repository to your addons and install: https://github.com/bwoodworth/hassio-addons

* Set config options:
  
  MQTT_server - IP address of MQTT server
  
  MQTT_port - MQTT server IP
  
  MQTT_user - MQTT server username
  
  MQTT_password - MQTT server password

  MQTT_wait - Wait time listening for a new command, effectively the time between MQTT message groups
  
  ScreenLogic_server - IP address of the ScreenLogic controller

* Add the entities from configuration-entries.yaml to the HASS configuration...use those command_topic and state_topic attributes exactly as that's what the addon is using.  Restart your Home Assistant so you see the new entities.

* You should be getting values into the sensor entities and be able to turn the configured circuits ON/OFF
